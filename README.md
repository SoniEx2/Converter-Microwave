Converter Microwave
===================

The Converter Microwave is an open hardware project for converting any cavity
magnetron microwave into an inverter microwave.

In some places, it can be really hard to buy an inverter microwave. The
Converter Microwave is meant to provide a solution to that problem.

Additionally, it can also serve as an adjustable constant current power supply
for driving vacuum tubes.
